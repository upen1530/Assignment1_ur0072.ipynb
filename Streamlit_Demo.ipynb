        "\n",
        "## Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "In this demo, we'll build an interactive **Student Grade Tracker** web app using Streamlit. The app lets users filter student grades by name, view subject-wise performance, calculate averages, and explore all student data in a table. This project teaches you the core skills of Streamlit: interactive widgets, data manipulation with pandas, dynamic layouts, and real-time app reactivity—all without writing complex HTML/CSS/JavaScript!\n",
        "\n",
        "## What Happens in Each Cell\n",
        "\n",
        "We've organized the demo into 10 cells for easy learning. **Cells 1-9** build the app piece-by-piece (install packages → create UI → add data → deploy). Each cell appends new code to a file called `app.py`. **Cell 10** runs your complete app using ngrok, which creates a public URL you can share with others. When users interact with your app (selecting a student, moving a slider), Streamlit instantly re-runs the script and updates all outputs—that's the magic of Streamlit!\n",
        "\n",
        "## Running the Demo\n",
        "\n",
        "Simply run the cells in order from top to bottom. After **Cell 1** installs packages and **Cells 2-9** build your app, you'll reach **Cell 10** where the app launches. After ~10-15 seconds, you'll see a public URL like `https://xxxx.ngrok.io`. Click it to see your live app! You can interact with it immediately (select students, move sliders, view tables) and share the URL with classmates so they can use your app too.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Important Notes\n",
        "\n",
        "⚠️ The app only runs while your Colab session is active. If Colab times out (after ~30 mins of inactivity), the app stops and you'll need a new URL. Each time you run Cell 10, you get a fresh URL. For permanent hosting, deploy to Streamlit Cloud later. You'll need an ngrok account (free at ngrok.com) and your auth token to run Cell 10. **Let's build!** 🚀"
